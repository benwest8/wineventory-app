# Making a Dynamic Wine Menu

I was scrolling through upwork looking for projects where I could practice React.js, and this one seemed fun and simple enough. For this project, I used create-react-app to hook into an airtable db and display a dynamic wine menu. The wine menu can only be editted in the airtable.
