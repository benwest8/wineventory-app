# Making a Dynamic Wine Menu

I recently signed up for upwork to look for small freelance projects. For this project, I used create-react-app to hook into an airtable db and display a dynamic wine menu. The wine menu can only be editted in the airtable. 

# Running the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
